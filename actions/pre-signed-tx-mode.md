# Pre-signed Tx Mode

The Sender of a pre-signed transaction is the EoA (Externally Owned Account) address utilized by the user for signing the transaction.&#x20;

Below, Pre-sign tx's #0 denotes the content of the pre-signed transaction, with provision for the inclusion of multiple transactions. It's important to note that the nonce of each transaction must be incremented by 1.&#x20;

Upon pasting the pre-signed transaction into the input box, the system will autonomously pre-execute the transaction and verify the continuity of the nonce to validate the transaction's authenticity.
